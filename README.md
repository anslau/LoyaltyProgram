Branches information are listed below. 

HEAD tracks master. Since on Markus we had some trouble with branch master, we decided to create a new branch called authContextNew and treating that as the master instead. 

authContext was pretty early on. authContextNew / main was built on authContext. 

pointsDashboard built on authContextNew. 

organizers built on authContextNew / main. 

authContextNew - createUserForTesting - promotionEvents - managerPromotionEvent (later ones built on previous ones)

managerUserList built on managerPromotionEvent
